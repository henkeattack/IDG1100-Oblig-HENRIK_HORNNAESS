    This open a personal crontab. In every line you have now five commands for your cronjob. You can schedule by minute, hour, day in a month, month or day of a week - in that order. Her is an example:
    30 * * * *
    Now we want to print the cronjob for todays date only:
    echo "Task scheduled at $date + "The date is %F ". Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today's date. "
    Use of the command %F print the full date of today.

One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
    changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
